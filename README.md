# ETL Project


## Project Proposal

A bunch of data came in and you and your team are tasked with migrating it to a production data base.

## Data

The project uses the following sources of data:

* Apple Mobiltiy

* Google Community Mobility Reports

* NYT COVID U.S cases and death report


## Data Cleanup & Analysis

Performed ETL on the data. 

* The sources of data that you will extract from.

* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).

* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).

* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.

## Project Report

Team submitted a Final Report that described the following:

* **E**xtract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).

* **T**ransform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.

* **L**oad: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
